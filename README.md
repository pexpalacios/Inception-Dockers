# Inception-Dockers
42 Milestone 5

Inception is about the creation and usage of dockers. The subject asks you to make three images, each with their own docker: mariadb, wordpress and nginx. It also asks for two volumes, one for mariadb and another one for wordpress. The three services connect to each other and you should be able to see a wordpress page that uses the mariadb database though your localhost or login.42.fr (penpalac.42.fr in my case).

## STATUS
Right now they kind of work, though the page says it is forbidden. However, the option to configure the wordpress page is avilable. Also need to do the certificate for a secure connection, something about nginx.
