# Inception-Dockers
42 Milestone 5

Inception is about the creation and usage of dockers. The subject asks you to make three images, each with their own docker: mariadb, wordpress and nginx. It also asks for two volumes, one for mariadb and another one for wordpress. The three services connect to each other and you should be able to see a wordpress page that uses the mariadb database though your localhost or login.42.fr (penpalac.42.fr in my case).

## STATUS
Everything works fine right now. I kept being unable to logging into wordpress but now that's solved.
I'm aware I shouldn't upload the .env nor secrets but tbh it's more convinient for me. Plus, they got no sensitive information.
